# react-checklist
In this application you will find my work in the Front - End part of the React.JS framework which you can add items in a list and then delete or Cross them when you have to check the items that you want. In this project I use concepts like Components , Decomposition with the props useState Hook , Thinking &amp; Uplifting State Up to Components .
